# Slides.com Clone (ish) with WordPress & Vue.js

This is a simple way to use the WordPress REST API in conjunction with Vue.js to present a slide deck.

I used this at WordCamp Atlanta 2018 when I gave a talk on WordPress & Vue.js.

## Features!

- Use it to give a presentation, then blow everyone's mind when they find out how it's built!
- Lightning fast when loading from a local WordPress install
- Includes "Night Mode" for improved visibility when you're not sure how the lighting will look at your conference
- And so much more!!!

## Guide

1. Just swap out the URL (in index.html) with your local WordPress installation
2. Use Posts in your local WordPress install. Each post = a slide.
3. You might need to tweak some classes for images and so for in the CSS to get it how you want.

Check out [slide.erickar.be](http://slides.erickar.be) for an example.
